# Vertical-farming

The cutting edge of the agriculture is vertical farming. This paperâ€™s centric goal is to give a different dimension to vertical farming and carry it to the next level by the touch of the state-of-the-art Machine learning AND Internet of things(IOT). In the past few decades, the apocalyptic deeds by the humans to the nature pushed the agriculture to a critical stage to practice farming in the concealed environment (closed room, godown, etc.). As the plants are grown in an artificial environment, utmost care and monitoring should be taken to grow them, as if they are grown in the fresh nature. Internet of things contributes a lot in this hypothesis and it will be discussed deeply. Machine learning is going to be the game changer in vertical farming. Machine learning is the heart of the farm and would have a complete control over the plants growth in atomic level. The future of mankind needs agriculture to be sustained by joining hands with the neo-technologies.
